Article: EEG biomarker candidates for the identification of epilepsy 
When a patient suffers a seizure, it is not guaranteed that they will develop Epilepsy from the seizure that they experienced. Since other factors can cause a human to experience a seizure, it's hard for medical professionals to pinpoint a diagnosis for the patient. There’s a concern and a sense of worriment that the doctors might not take the right corrective action to help the patient that suffered the seizure. (EEG are the measurement of electrical activity in different parts of the brain). EEG biomarkers are markers that should be able to detect certain IED signals in the brain. IEDs are large intermittent electrophysiological events observed between seizures in patients with epilepsy. IED’s can prove useful in detecting early stages of Epilepsy. When performing an IED’s on patients who have a clear case of epilepsy, they yield a negative EEG. Meaning that the measurement of electrical activity in the patient’s brain is very little. Overall, making it hard to see the IED’s that are clearly present. Some remarks on this were to think that the IEDs were very weak and couldn’t get seen past the exterior of the scalp or to increase the number of EEG’s that were used to help get a better representation of the electrical currents going on in the brain.
